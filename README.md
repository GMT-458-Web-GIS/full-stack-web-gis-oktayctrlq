# GMT 458 - Full Stack Web GIS Project

This repository contains the final project for the **GMT 458 - Web GIS** course. The project is a web-based Geographic Information System that allows users to perform spatial operations, manage data, and visualize geographic information on an interactive map.

## 👤 Student Information
* **Name:** Oktay   
* **Student ID:** Duman

## 🚀 Project Overview
The application is designed as a Full Stack solution. It provides an interactive map interface for users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) spatial data. The system is secured with user authentication and supports different user roles.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla), Leaflet.js
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL)
* **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Postman, Git
